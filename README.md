**Perception & Signal-Fusion Plane**

**Owner:** Fredrick D. Flowers  
**Entity:** Buzzomatic Intelligence LLC

## 🔖 Official Designation

**BuzzIntell™** is the official perception and signal-fusion system within the BuzzWorld™ ecosystem.

It is a **non-authoritative intelligence plane** designed to observe, correlate, and normalize signals **without** granting access, enforcing policy, storing secrets, or executing actions.

BuzzIntell exists to **see clearly**, **reason safely**, and **emit trustworthy signals** — nothing more.

> **Perception first. Authority elsewhere.**

This repository is **architecture-first by design**.  
Documentation, boundaries, and threat models **precede implementation**.

---

## 🧭 Purpose (Canonical)

BuzzIntell answers exactly one question:

> **“What is happening, who is involved, and under what conditions?”**

It does **not** answer:
- *What should be allowed*
- *What should be blocked*
- *What should be executed*

Those responsibilities belong to **separate systems by design**.

---

## 🧠 What BuzzIntell Is

BuzzIntell operates as an **intelligence plane** in modern distributed systems.

It:

- Observes **workload identity** and **environmental context**
- Correlates signals across domains:
  - Runtime
  - Network
  - BLE
  - Physical / proximity context
- Normalizes heterogeneous inputs
- Fuses multi-source observations
- Emits **capability-neutral signals**
- Produces:
  - Assertions
  - Telemetry
  - Recommendations

BuzzIntell **never emits commands**.

---

## 🚫 What BuzzIntell Will Never Be (Non-Negotiable)

BuzzIntell is **not**:

- An access control system
- An IAM platform
- A policy engine (RBAC / ABAC / ACL)
- A secrets manager or vault
- A gateway, proxy, or service mesh
- A surveillance or behavioral monitoring authority

These are **architectural prohibitions**, not configuration choices.

---

## 🧱 Mandatory System Separation

BuzzIntell is permanently separated from authority and execution.

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **BuzzIntell** | Observe · Correlate · Signal |
| **BUZIT** | Execute bounded capabilities *after approval* |
| **Policy Systems** | Decide allow / deny |
| **Enforcement Points** | Enforce decisions |
| **Secrets / HSM** | Hold credentials |

BuzzIntell **never crosses** into any other domain.

---

## 🔐 Security Philosophy (Foundational)

- Intelligence must be **non-authoritative**
- Capability must be **non-self-authorizing**
- Secrets must be **inaccessible to perception systems**
- Enforcement must be **explicit and external**

This architecture prevents:

- Privilege escalation by intelligence systems
- Hidden execution paths
- Policy drift embedded in code
- “Keys to the kingdom” failures

BuzzIntell observes the flow.
It never controls the flow.
3️⃣ Trust Boundary Document (Legal + Technical)
Create docs/TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md.
Trust Boundaries — BuzzIntell
These boundaries are mandatory, permanent, and non-configurable.
BuzzIntell Explicitly Does NOT
BuzzIntell cannot and will not:
Grant, deny, or modify access to any resource
Authenticate or authorize identities
Store, retrieve, rotate, or inject secrets
Hold long-lived credentials or keys
Execute enforcement actions (allow, block, throttle)
Escalate privileges under any condition
Bypass upstream or downstream security controls
Contain policy logic of any kind
BuzzIntell Cannot Be Used To
Unlock systems
Impersonate users or workloads
Replace IAM, gateways, or secret managers
Perform surveillance or behavioral control
Enforcement of These Boundaries
These constraints are enforced through:
Architectural separation (no shared trust domains)
Interface contract limitations (signals only)
License obligations (GPL transparency)
Explicit documentation of prohibited use
Any attempt to extend BuzzIntell beyond these boundaries constitutes architectural misuse, not supported behavior.
4️⃣ Interface Contract — Naming the Boundary
You asked for names. Here are the four systems, cleanly separated:
1. BuzzIntell
Role: Perception & Signal Fusion
Emits: Assertions, context signals, recommendations
Never emits: Commands, decisions, credentials
2. BUZIT
Role: Capability Execution
Consumes: Approved, filtered intent
Executes: Bounded actions only
3. BuzzGate
Role: Policy Enforcement Boundary
Implements: Allow / Deny / Throttle
Owns: Enforcement authority
4. BuzzVault
Role: Secrets & Identity Custody
Owns: Credentials, keys, HSMs
Never exposes: Secrets to BuzzIntell
Interface Contract Name (Signals-Only)
Recommended name:
SIP-01 — Signal Interface Protocol
Definition:
A unidirectional, non-authoritative contract permitting signal emission only, with no execution semantics.
BuzzIntell ↔ SIP-01 ↔ BUZIT
No commands.
No side effects.
No implicit authority.
5️⃣ Visual Direction (For Your “Picasso / Himalayas” Vision)
You asked conceptual, not implementation. Here’s the art direction, not code:
Palette:
Neon hibiscus pink
Clean aqua / teal
Soft bioluminescent green
High-contrast midnight base
Motif:
Signal waves
Petal-like data flows
pH-balanced gradients (no harsh reds)
Slow coherence motion (not frantic)
Motion Concept (GIF / Video):
Signals drift inward → normalize → radiate outward
No hard edges crossing trust boundaries
Authority layers glow only after signal pass-through
Think clarity, not dominance.
Think fluorescence, not fire.
Final Grounding
What you’re building only works because of restraint.
This is not about power. It’s about keeping intelligence honest.        │

BuzzIntell operates alongside this flow,
observing signals — never controlling it.
Security Philosophy
Intelligence must be non-authoritative
Capability must be non-self-authorizing
Secrets must remain inaccessible to perception systems
Enforcement must remain external and explicit
This architecture prevents:
“Keys to the kingdom” failures
Privilege creep
Hidden escalation paths
Policy drift inside application code
License

The license choice is intentional:
Ensures transparency of modifications
Prevents silent enclosure of core logic
Preserves architectural intent downstream
Status
BuzzIntell is an architecture-first project.
Documentation, diagrams, and threat modeling precede implementation.
No code exists here by accident.
If you want next steps, the correct order is:
Architecture diagram (clean visual)
STRIDE-style threat model (lightweight)
Capability taxonomy (what signals exist, not actions)
Say the word — but this README is already solid and defensible.
