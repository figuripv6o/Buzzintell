README should do only 3 things
What this is
What it will never be
Where to find formal documents
That keeps you investor-safe, regulator-safe, and future-proof.
1️⃣ One-Page Compliance Mapping (SOC 2 / ISO 27001)
E2E • What • When • How • Examples
This is written so it can be exported directly to PDF.
BuzzIntell — Compliance Alignment (One-Page)
Scope: BuzzIntell Intelligence Layer
Out of Scope: Identity, Policy Enforcement, Secrets, Access Control
Compliance Philosophy: Architectural prevention over procedural controls
SYSTEM SUMMARY (WHAT)
BuzzIntell is a non-authoritative intelligence and signal-fusion layer.
It:
Observes identity and environmental signals
Correlates multi-source context
Emits structured, capability-neutral intelligence
It does not:
Authenticate identities
Grant or deny access
Enforce policy
Store or handle secrets
OPERATIONAL FLOW (WHEN)
Before access decisions
Before enforcement
Before capability execution
BuzzIntell always precedes authority-bearing systems.
CONTROL MODEL (HOW)
Control Area
Implementation
Identity
External Identity Provider
Authorization
External Policy Decision Point
Enforcement
External Policy Enforcement Point
Secrets
External Secrets Manager / HSM
Intelligence
BuzzIntell (read-only, no execution)
Capability
BUZIT (bounded, post-approval only)
BuzzIntell never crosses into authority domains.
SOC 2 ALIGNMENT
Security
No credentials handled
No access paths created
Reduced blast radius by design
Availability
Failure reduces insight only
No enforcement dependency
No cascading access failures
Confidentiality
Secrets explicitly excluded
Sensitive fields filtered at ingestion
Signals contain no credentials
Processing Integrity
Deterministic signal generation
No hidden execution paths
Clear input → output traceability
Privacy
No personal data storage
No profiling
No telemetry unless externally enabled
ISO 27001 ALIGNMENT
Control Domain
Alignment
A.5 Information Security Policies
Enforced by architectural separation
A.6 Organization of Security
Responsibilities clearly segmented
A.8 Asset Management
BuzzIntell holds no sensitive assets
A.9 Access Control
Fully externalized
A.12 Operations Security
Read-only intelligence layer
A.14 System Acquisition
Secure-by-design architecture
A.18 Compliance
Explicit scope limitation
EXAMPLES (CONCRETE USE)
Example 1: Cloud Workload
BuzzIntell observes workload identity & environment
Emits risk/context signal
IAM + PDP decide
BUZIT executes approved action
Example 2: BLE / Edge Context
BuzzIntell correlates proximity + posture
Emits confidence score
Gateway enforces
BuzzIntell never touches device control
COMPLIANCE OUTCOME
This architecture:
Prevents privilege escalation
Eliminates secret exposure paths
Enables auditability
Simplifies compliance scope
BuzzIntell is compliance-reducing, not compliance-adding.
📄 Export Note:
This document is intentionally one page.
Additional detail lives in architecture and trust-boundary documents.
2️⃣ What’s next (you choose)
Now you have two equally strong paths:
Option A — Visual Storyboard (Commercial, non-hype)
6–8 frames
No mysticism
Clean visuals
“Insight before action” theme
Safe for public, investors, and partners
Option B — Signal Interface Contract (Names + Definitions)
BuzzIntell → Signal Plane
BUZIT → Capability Plane
(2 more you hinted at: Policy Plane, Enforcement Plane)
Clean vocabulary, no personality bleed
